##
# This module just declares some constants for each normalizer we need. There are two places that we need do normalization:
# 1. When indexing fields of an entity, for example we might want to normalize `MegaCÃ¶rp` to `megacorp`, or normalize
#    a datetime string into a datetime object so we can perform range search
# 2. When the user inputs a search query, we need to also normalize the query first using the same logic when indexing
#    the field before we do the search, otherwise we can't match the terms
#
# So we require each normalizer implements two methods,
# - normalize_field_value: This is called when indexing an entity, it can throw exception to show that the field value is not valid
# - normalize_search_term: Usually the search term is a string, and we need to normalize it into a value that we can 
#   do comparision with the terms stored in inverted_index
#
# For each normalizer's implementation, check `normailizers` folder
